				<h>1.To protect and improve the environment quality.</h>
				<img src="photo.gif" align="right">
				<p>Prevent and control degradation of land, water, vegetation and air. Conserve and enhance natural and man-made heritage, including biological diversity of unique ecosystems. Improve condition and productivity of degraded areas. Raise awareness and understanding of the link between environment and development.When we talk about environmental quality, then, weâ€™re talking about the quality of our total environment, not just the natural environment.  Environmental quality is a measure of the health of that environment itself (including the plants and animals it supports), and of the effects it has on the health, comfort, and psychological state of the people that inhabit it.</p><br><hr>
				<h>2.To establish an authority to study,plan and implement long term requirement of environmental safety.</h>
					<p>Infrastructure for implementation and accountability: Two distinct types of new or expanded infrastructure are needed for implementing the strategy: expansion of institutional arrangements, including interagency coordination, stakeholder engagement, public-private partnerships, and management of potential conflicts of interest; and mechanisms for integrating informatics and information-sharing into the research structure.<br>i.<i>Evaluation of research progress and revision of the strategy</i>: A critical element of an effective research strategy is the inclusion of processes for evaluation of progress in relation to the goals of the strategy and for refinement and adaptation of the strategy as the information base evolves and drives the need for change.<br>ii.<i>Resources needed to conduct research and implement the strategy</i>: An integral part of an effective strategy is a means for continuing assessment of resources for conducting the research and for implementing the strategy. That includes assessing the adequacy of current resources, how they are to be deployed, and how additional resources would best be acquired and used.<br>iii.<i>Key audiences for implementing the strategy</i>: The strategy should effectively consider and integrate the needs of and appropriate roles for the full array of stakeholders involved in implementing the strategy or concerned with its outcomes. These stakeholders include the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) and the federal agencies within its structure; the private sector, including nanomaterial developers and users; consumers; and the broader scientific community, including academic researchers and non-governmental organizations.<br>Many of the questions posed in formulating a strategy for research on nanomaterials are equally applicable to strategies that might be developed for other emerging technologies. Lack of knowledge and high degrees of uncertainty, with a rapidly changing landscape of perceived risks and benefits, are inherent in the rollout of any new technology. As with nanomaterial research, there are likely to be challenges in developing common protocols for a community of researchers that turns its attention to the evaluation of the environmental and health implications of any new technology and seeks to compare the results of research among laboratories. For those reasons, the proposed research strategy can be considered a model approach for developing a strategy that examines the risks produced by other emerging technologies.</p><hr>
					<h>3.To give direction and to coordinate system of adequate response to emergency situations threatening the environment.</h>
						<p>Intervention to address disasters has evolved through time into a complex policy subsystem, and disaster policy is implemented through a set of functions known as emergency management and response. Modern approaches to emergency management and response involve multidimensional efforts to reduce our vulnerability to hazards; to diminish the impact of disasters; and to prepare for, respond to, and recover from those that occur. These responsibilities present formidable challenges for governments because of the extraordinary demands disaster events impose on the decision-making systems and service delivery infrastructure of the communities they affect. Moreover, by definition an event constitutes a disaster if it exceeds the capacity of the government or governments in whose jurisdiction it occurs. Dealing with disaster therefore requires outside resources. In the context of a federally structured government, when the capacities of government jurisdictions at lower levels are overwhelmed, higher levels are called upon to assist, by either supporting or supplanting the activities of the subordinate jurisdictions. Likewise, assets and capabilities in the corporate and nongovernmental sectors may be brought to bear. As a result, emergency management and response are intrinsically intergovernmental, cross-sector policy implementation challenges. Also, since disasters dramatically affect our physical, social, and economic geography, geospatial requirements and capabilities are embedded throughout this complex system. This chapter describes the key characteristics of disasters and the conventional phased approach to their management, with particular attention to geospatial needs and functions.</p><hr>
						<h>4.Prevention and control pollution</h>
						<p>The Kathmandu valley, nestled in the midst of the mighty Himalaya, is one of the worth visiting places in the world. Unplanned urbanization, increasing population, polluting vehicles and industries have started degrading the environment in the valley. Centralized development activities in the last two decades resulted in undesirable environmental change. If the current trend continues, valley will loose its importance. Realizing the importance of healthy environment, His Majesty's Government of Nepal has formed the Environment Protection Council under the chairmanship of Prime Minister to formulate environmental planning and policies. Over two dozen active NGOs are involved in environmental awareness and management in the Kathmandu valley. Some major steps have been undertaken by GOs and NGOs. Present paper deals with the state of pollution, efforts made to minimize it, and major actions/strategies for preventing pollution in the Kathmandu valley.</p><hr>
						<h>5.conservation and survey of flora,fauna,forest and wildlife.</h>
						<p>Wildlife diversity is a notable feature of Nepal. Because of the variance in climate, from tropical to arctic, Nepal has a large variety of plants and animals.[1] Wildlife tourism is also a major source of tourism in the country. There are some animal species which are unique to Nepal, such as the spiny babbler. Nepal is also host to a large number of rhododendron species. The wildlife of Nepal includes its flora and fauna. Nepal has established numerous National Parks and reserves in order to protect its diverse fauna. Nepal is a biodiversity hot spot with ecoregions broadly comprising the mountainous ecoregion, the savanna and grasslands ecoregion of the terai (foothills), and the Rara Lake ecoregion, which has many endemic species.</p><hr><pre>
